## Taking notes for life-long learners
#### or Building a personal knowledge base


### Basic principles
1. Take atomic notes.
2. Prioritize ideas over quotes.
3. Write notes out in complete sentences.
4. Always record the source of the note.


### Simple Workflow

1. Take daily notes (Think of this as an inbox)
    * Shower thoughts, reading notes, etc.
    * Be concise but complete.
    * For each chapter, book, blog, or video, write down 2-3 key ideas.

2. Tag notes
    * Review daily notes at the end of the day.
    * Contextualize your new notes in the context of your existing notes.

3. Convert _select_ daily notes into permanent notes
    * Not all daily notes are worth keeping.
    * Write out permanent notes in complete sentences as though you were writing for someone else.
    * Link your new permanent notes to related existing notes.
